Henson', 'Octavia Spencer', 'Janelle Monáe']","['Biography', 'Drama', 'History']",['7.8'],"As the United States raced against Russia to put a man in space, NASA found untapped talent in a group of African-American female mathematicians that served as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in U.S. history.
